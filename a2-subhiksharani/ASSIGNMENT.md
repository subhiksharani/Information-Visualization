# INF 554 Assignment 2

## Description

- Use UN Data for the same 10 countries of Assignment 1.
- Create `index.html`. 
- Add explanations of the dataset and provenance in `index.html`.
- Create a bubble cloud with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) and add it to the repository.
- Add the SVG created with Inkscape in `index.html` using the `<img>` tag.
- Create SVG elements for the bubble cloud. Do not paste the SVG generated by Inkscape, instead look at the SVG created by Inkscape in a text editor to see what attributes and values you need to position and style and write your own SVG code. 
- Dynamically generate the bubble cloud using SVG and javascript in `index.html`.
- Add the line chart of Assignment 1 recreated using the [Google Charts library](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/)
- Optionally you can separate your code in files, e.g., `index.html`, `style.css` and `chart.js`.
- Describe your data and charts as needed in the page.

- Use browsersync to develop and document your set-up in `README.md`.

## Rubric

__15% of the grade is for artifacts generated and commited in class as requested by the instructor.__

|               | Development   | Inkspape SVG | SVG code, Dynamic SVG, Google Charts line chart |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Sophisticated | Demonstrated use of node.js and sound Web development techniques, well documented, shows proficiency in using git (4-5 pts)| Prototype is well thought out showing both relations and quantities (4-5 pts)| Code is cleanly written and working (4-5 pts each) |
| Competent     | Not using or not demonstrated use of node.js and Web development techniques, some documentation, shows some proficiency in using git (2-3 pts) | Prototype shows some thoughts and/or showing some relations and quantities (2-3 pts)| Code cleanly written with minor problems (2-3 pts each)|
| Needs work    | Not using node.js and Web editor, poorly or not documented, not using git appropriately (0-1 pts)| Prototype is not well thought out and/or not showing relations and quantities (0-1 pts)| Code not well written and/or not debugged (0-1 pts each)|
