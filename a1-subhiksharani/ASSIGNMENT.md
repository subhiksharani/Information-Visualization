# INF 554 Assignment 1

## Description

- For 10 countries select [UN data of your choice containing data over time](http://data.un.org).
- Import the data in Google Sheets and format the data to create a [line chart](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/63728).
- Create a web page named `index.html`
- Add explanations on the dataset and provenance
- Add a link to the Google Sheet file (__create the Google Sheet with your USC account__ then share it so that _Anyone at University of Southern California_ can access it)
- Add two charts to the page:
 1. The picture of the chart you created in Google Sheet
 2. The Google Sheets chart you created embedded using `<iframe>`
- Open `index.html` in the browser and make sure it works as expected
- Commit your changes after you implement a complete step and you test
